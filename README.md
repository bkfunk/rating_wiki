What makes a good Wikipedia page?

Using data on ratings for Wikipedia pages, I try to explore that question.

Wikimedia provides a one-year dump of all ratings on Wikipedia, from July 22, 2011 up to July 22, 2012. This file contains almost 50 million records of almost 12 million unique ratings (NB: there are 4 dimensions for each rating, so one person rating an article will provide up to 4 data points).

The file (approx 441.6 MB gzipped) is hosted here:
